Yes, let's discuss this! I completely agree—expanding the quiz makes a lot of sense. The original 100 questions give a solid broad overview, but breaking it into more focused sections (sub-topics) with varying numbers of questions will make it feel more balanced, educational, and engaging. Some topics naturally have more depth (like history, especially wars, freedom struggle, or Constitution details), while others are shorter (like national symbols or basic economy facts).

### My Thoughts on Structure and Question Counts
We can keep the **core sections** from before but expand them, and add a few new ones to cover more ground as an "essential Indian citizen knowledge" quiz series. Aim for **total around 200–300 questions** if we want a comprehensive set (easy to split into multiple quizzes or levels). Not fixed per section—let the topic decide:

- **Constitution & Fundamental Rights/Duties** → This is core for citizens → Expand to **20–30 questions** (lots of articles, amendments, duties, etc.)
- **Important Laws, Rights & Everyday Citizen Knowledge** → Practical stuff like traffic rules, women's rights, consumer laws → **20–25 questions**
- **History** → Broad and rich → Split into sub-sections if needed (Ancient/Medieval/Modern/Freedom Struggle/Wars/Post-Independence) → Overall **40–60 questions** (wars and freedom struggle can have 15–20 each)
- **Geography** → Physical + Political + Economic → **25–35 questions** (rivers, states, resources, climate, etc.)
- **Government & Polity Structure** → Union, State, Local, Elections → **20–30 questions**
- **National Symbols, Anthem, Flag, Mottos** → Short but iconic → **10–15 questions**
- **Culture, Festivals, Heritage** → Diverse India → **15–25 questions** (languages, dances, UNESCO sites, traditions)
- **Economy Basics & Current Affairs Basics** → GDP, RBI, schemes, poverty → **15–20 questions**
- **New: Environment, Science & Tech in India** → Rivers pollution, ISRO, renewable energy → **10–15 questions** (relevant for citizens today)
- **New: Defense, Borders & Neighbors** → Armed forces, wars recap, neighboring countries → **10–15 questions**

This way, it's not rigid—history gets more because it's event-heavy, while symbols stay concise. We can create it as a "master quiz document" with sections, and later make mini-quizzes per topic.

### Suggestions for Expansion
Here are some ideas for additional questions per section (based on common citizen/competitive exam knowledge). I can flesh them out fully if you like any.

What do you think—should we prioritize history/wars first since you mentioned that? Or start expanding one section at a time (e.g., let's do Constitution + Laws to 50 total)? Pick a section or two, and I'll draft 10–20 new questions with answers right away. Or any new sections you'd like to add? 😊
