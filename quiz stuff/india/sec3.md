Here we go with the next section!

**Section 3: Key Historical Events** (expanded to ~45 questions).

This is one of the richer sections, so I've beefed it up with more depth—especially on the freedom struggle, major wars (as you highlighted), and post-independence events. Questions draw from standard competitive exam (UPSC/SSC) timelines, key movements, leaders, and turning points. I've grouped them loosely into sub-themes for easier quizzing: Pre-Modern/Colonial buildup, Freedom Struggle, Wars & Conflicts, and Post-Independence.

Questions are in Q&A format with accurate, concise answers.
