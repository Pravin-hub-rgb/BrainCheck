Here we go—adding the **new Section 9: Science & Technology in India (including ISRO & Key Milestones)** (~20 questions).

This section focuses on India's major S&T achievements, especially space (ISRO's role, missions like Chandrayaan, Aditya-L1, SpaDeX, Gaganyaan progress), nuclear, digital/tech innovations, and recent 2025-2026 milestones. It's inspiring for citizens—covers self-reliance in tech, space as a symbol of progress, and practical impacts (e.g., satellites for weather, navigation, disaster management).

Questions are Q&A format, up-to-date as of early 2026 (e.g., India has 44 UNESCO sites confirmed with Maratha Military Landscapes as the latest in 2025; Intangible ICH at 16 with Deepavali added in 2025; ISRO milestones include SpaDeX docking success in Jan 2025, Gaganyaan uncrewed tests targeted 2026 leading to crewed ~2027-2028).

5. **What was Chandrayaan-3's major achievement?**  
   Answer: Successful soft landing near lunar south pole on August 23, 2023; made India the fourth country to soft-land on Moon and first at south pole.

6. **What is Aditya-L1, and where is it positioned?**  
   Answer: India's first solar observatory mission; launched September 2, 2023; reached halo orbit around Sun-Earth L1 point January 6, 2024 (studies solar corona, flares, space weather).

7. **What milestone did SpaDeX achieve for India in 2025?**  
   Answer: Successful autonomous docking and undocking of two satellites (SDX-01 & SDX-02) on January 16, 2025; India became the fourth country to demonstrate spacecraft docking.

8. **What is NISAR, and why is it significant?**  
   Answer: NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar mission; launched via GSLV-F16 in 2025; joint Earth observation satellite for mapping ecosystems, disasters, climate change.

9. **What is Gaganyaan, and what is its current status in 2026?**  
   Answer: India's human spaceflight programme; aims to send astronauts (Gaganyatris) to low Earth orbit; three uncrewed test flights targeted in 2026, first crewed mission expected no earlier than 2027-2028.

10. **Who was the first Indian astronaut to visit the ISS under Gaganyaan collaboration?**  
    Answer: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla; participated in Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4) from June 25 to July 15, 2025 (18 days on ISS).

11. **What is India's indigenous navigation system?**  
    Answer: NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation); 7-satellite regional system for accurate positioning (better than GPS in India/South Asia).

12. **Which launch vehicle is India's heaviest and used for Chandrayaan-3?**  
    Answer: LVM3 (Launch Vehicle Mark-3, formerly GSLV Mk III); human-rated version for Gaganyaan.

13. **What was India's record for most satellites launched in a single mission?**  
    Answer: 104 satellites in PSLV-C37 on February 15, 2017 (still holds world record for single launch).

14. **What is India's first indigenous semiconductor chip for space applications?**  
    Answer: IRIS (RISC-V Controller for Space Applications); developed by IIT Madras and ISRO (demonstrates self-reliance in space electronics).

15. **How many foreign satellites has ISRO launched cumulatively (as of 2026)?**  
    Answer: Over 434 (from various countries; commercial arm NSIL handles many).

16. **What is XPoSat, and when was it launched?**  
    Answer: X-ray Polarimeter Satellite; launched January 1, 2024; studies black holes, neutron stars, pulsar emissions (India's first dedicated polarimetry mission).

17. **Which mission demonstrated India's reusable launch vehicle tech?**  
    Answer: RLV-TD (Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator); successful flights since 2016; precursor to future cost-effective launches.

18. **What is India's contribution to global space efforts in 2025-2026?**  
    Answer: Hosted 20th UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Committee session (Dec 2025); strong in small satellite launches, Earth observation for disaster management.

19. **What percentage of India's tech patents in AI were filed domestically in recent years?**  
    Answer: Around 63% of 86,000+ AI patents from 2010-2025 originated in India (rapid growth in AI, space tech patents).

20. **Why is India's space programme considered cost-effective?**  
    Answer: Low-budget missions (e.g., Mangalyaan cost ~$74 million vs. NASA's similar missions billions); focus on indigenous tech, frugal engineering, and dual-use applications for development.

This new section rounds out the quiz with modern pride points—space achievements motivate national spirit and show India's rise as a tech power.
