This completes the main sections—now you have a comprehensive ~200+ question master quiz across 8 sections! Great for creating a full quiz app, booklet, or series of trivia games.

What next? We can:
- Add a new section (e.g., Science & Tech/ISRO, Environment/Climate, Defense/Armed Forces, or Neighbors/Borders as I suggested earlier).
- Compile all sections into one big document.
- Make sample multiple-choice versions or add scoring tips.
- Tweak any section (e.g., more current affairs or visuals if needed).

Just say what you'd like—e.g., "add science section", "compile everything", or "next new topic"! 😊
