Got it! We'll go one section at a time, building on what we had before and expanding with more accurate, essential questions based on reliable sources like the Constitution itself, standard references, and common citizen/competitive exam knowledge.

Starting with the **first major section**: **Indian Constitution and Fundamental Rights & Duties**.

I've expanded it significantly to around **30 questions** total (original ~15 + new ones). This covers:
- Preamble & basic structure
- Fundamental Rights (6 categories in detail)
- Key Articles
- Fundamental Duties (full list with examples)
- Important amendments & facts
- Some citizen-relevant points

Questions are in Q&A format for easy quiz use. Answers are clear and sourced from the Constitution/articles.
