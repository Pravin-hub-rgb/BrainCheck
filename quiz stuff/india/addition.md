Yes, I've incorporated those suggested additions (and a few more refinements based on the latest accurate info as of 2026) into the relevant sections.

These fit seamlessly—Geography gets more depth on borders/rivers/climate, Polity on institutions, Culture on arts/heritage.

Since we've covered the main 8 sections, let's add one **new section** as you requested. I suggest **Section 9: Science & Technology in India (including ISRO & Key Milestones)** — it's citizen-relevant, inspiring, and has good quiz potential (space, nuclear, digital India, etc.). Or pick one: Environment/Climate, Defense/Armed Forces, or Neighbors/Borders.

Which new section do you want to add next? (e.g., "add Science & Tech", "add Defense", etc.) Or if you prefer to compile everything into one master doc first, just say "compile all"! 😊
