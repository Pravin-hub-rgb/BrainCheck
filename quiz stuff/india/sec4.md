Here we go with the next section!

**Section 4: Basic Geography** (expanded to ~35 questions).

This covers **physical features** (mountains, plains, plateaus, deserts, coasts, islands), **political divisions** (states/UTs, borders), **rivers & drainage**, **climate & monsoons**, and key facts like location/extents/area. I've incorporated the latest updates (e.g., revised coastline length from official 2025 data: now 11,098.81 km total, due to better high-resolution mapping including intricate details and islands). Questions are practical for citizen knowledge and competitive exams.

Grouped loosely into sub-themes for easier quizzing.
